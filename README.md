What is Argentum?
----------------

Argentum is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Argentum uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Argentum is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately usable, binary version of
the Argentum software, see http://www.argentum.io, or read the
[original Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoincore.org/bitcoin.pdf).

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is occasionally built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/argentumproject/argentum/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Argentum.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Building
--------
See files in the [doc](doc) directory for generic build instructions for Windows,
OSX and Unix.

## Mining Settings
Use this to set the algorithm to SHA256D for mining (add to argentum.conf or use -algo=)  

algo=sha256d 
algo=lyra2re2 or lyra2 
algo=groestl 
algo=argon2d or argon 
algo=yescrypt 

## Mining Software (for best results, download specialized pool software from your pool of choice when able)
